# What is Obsidian? 🤔

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a **markdown-based knowledge management tool** that gives you complete control over your notes. Here’s what makes it special:

- **Plain Text Freedom**: Your notes are simple Markdown files that you can open with any text editor.
- **Linked Thinking**: Use `[[Internal Links]]` to connect notes, forming a web of knowledge.
- **Customizable Experience**: Tailor Obsidian to your workflow with themes, plugins, and custom scripts.
- **Offline First, Sync Optional**: Your data stays on your device, but syncing and collaboration options exist if needed.
- **A Second Brain**: Organize ideas, projects, research, and insights in a way that grows with you.

With these powerful features, Obsidian helps you turn scattered thoughts into a structured system of knowledge.

# How Does Obsidian Work? 🛠️

Understanding Obsidian’s core concepts will help you get the most out of it. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1️⃣ Notes & Markdown 📝

Everything in Obsidian is a plain text Markdown file. Markdown is a simple way to format text using symbols like `#` for headings and `**bold**` for emphasis.

You can structure your vault in multiple ways:

- **Databases (Dataview Plugin)**: Query and display your notes dynamically.

➡ **Best practices:** [[Tips for Organization]]

### 3️⃣ Creating Connections 🔗

The true power of Obsidian lies in its ability to interconnect ideas.

- Use `[[Internal Links]]` to create relationships between notes.
- See the big picture in **Graph View**, where linked notes form a visual network.
- Use **Backlinks** to discover which notes reference the current one.
