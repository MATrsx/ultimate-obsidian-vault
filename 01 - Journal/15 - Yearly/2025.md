# 80/20 Analysis

> [!SUMMARY]+ The analysis that will lead to results üìà
> An "80/20 analysis" is a way of finding the 20% of inputs that lead to 80% of the outputs.
>
> So the goal of this section is to identify the 20% of:
> - Beliefs ‚Ä¢ People ‚Ä¢ Habits ‚Ä¢ Routines ‚Ä¢ Environments ‚Ä¢ Etc.
> That led to 80% of your positive and negative results this year.
>
> This involves starting with a "brain dump" of everything you can think of that contributed to your positive and negative results in each area of your life.
>
> Then, you want to closely examine them to identify the 1-3 factors that contributed to 80% of the positive and negative outcomes. From there, you can brainstorm ways to further emphasize the key factors that lead to positive results and decisively eliminate the factors that lead to negative results.
>
> Repeated year after year, this process **guarantees** you are continuing to grow.
